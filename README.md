### Hi, I'm Gordon.

Welcome to my code. I hope you can find something useful.  
I've been coding since the mid 90's and I got interested in computers from my interest in how to make video games.  
Some things about me:  

* I'm slowly working on a [C++ game engine](https://github.com/gordonglas/mana-engine). More info is in my [indie studio site news](https://overworldsoft.com/news) posts.
* I'm also learning [Pico-8](https://github.com/gordonglas/pico-8).
* I made a [Breakout clone](https://github.com/gordonglas/gba-breakout) for Gameboy Advance a while back. It's not 100% complete, but is playable.
* You can reach me on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@kefka">Mastodon</a> or [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/alphatrak).
* I occasionally post random things to my [blog](https://gglas.ninja). [Code for my blog](https://github.com/gordonglas/gglas-ninja-astro) is also public.
* You can find more [about me](https://gglas.ninja/about) on my blog.
